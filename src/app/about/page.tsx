        SIGIL.ZERO is an occult-tinged electronic music imprint focused on
        high–impact, buy-on-sight releases. The catalog leans into dark,
        hypnotic, and industrial edges of techno and adjacent sounds, with a
        curation ethos built around quality control, longevity, and DJ
        usability.

        In the first phase of the label, the focus is on building a tight
        catalog of weapon-grade tracks and establishing a clear sonic and visual
        identity. Over time, SIGIL.ZERO will grow into a trusted mark for
        promoters, DJs, and listeners—something you can drop or stream on sight
        and know it will land.

        The label is based in Austin, TX, and run as a tightly curated project
        with close collaboration between artists, designers, and DJs who live
        inside the culture they’re soundtracking.
