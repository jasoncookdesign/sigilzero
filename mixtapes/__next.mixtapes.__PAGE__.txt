Cutting his teeth as an FM radio DJ before descending into the late-’90s Los Angeles underground, his sound was forged in an era where music was discovered at 3 AM, not optimized for feeds. That lineage still shows.\n\nToday, Dyson Hope channels decades of dancefloor intuition into forward-leaning, genre-agnostic records, dark techno pressure, warped breakbeats, experimental bass, and tech house grit braided into a single, coherent signal. His work favors tension over release, hypnosis over excess, and groove as a delivery system for weight.\n\nSIGIL.ZERO serves as both archive and evolution: the first official home for a long-buried back catalog alongside new material that proves the signal never faded—only sharpened."},{"meta":{"id":"b-squared","slug":"b-squared","name":"B²","order":1,"roles":["producer","dj"],"location":"Denver, CO","for_fans_of":["Archie Hamilton","Korolova","Orphic"],"photo":"/assets/images/artists/b-squared.jpg","instagram_handle":"dj.bellab.ig","social":{"instagram":"https://instagram.com/dj.bellab.ig","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/djbellab"},"booking_email":"dj.bellab.ig@gmail.com","label_join_year":2026,"active":true,"featured_releases":[],"featured_mixtapes":["b-squared-newmix-vol-1","b-squared-symphony-of-hearts","b-squared-smiles"],"genres_primary":["progressive house","tech house","melodic techno"],"tags":[]},"body":"\nB² brings clarity, lift, and emotional intelligence to the dancefloor.
