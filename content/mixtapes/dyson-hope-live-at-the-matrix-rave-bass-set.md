Recorded live at The Matrix Rave in Austin, TX, this bass-heavy set captures Dyson Hope in full cyberpunk mode, tearing through trapstep, dubstep, moombahcore, neuro breaks, and drum & bass with relentless intensity. Built for a dark warehouse floor, the mix leans hard into distorted low end, rapid-fire rhythmic shifts, and peak-time pressure, documenting one half of a high-impact dual-set night.
