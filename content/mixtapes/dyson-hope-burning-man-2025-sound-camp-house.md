Recorded live at a Burning Man sound camp in 2025, this set finds Dyson Hope leaning into high-energy house pressure built for peak crowd engagement. Funky tech house grooves, bass-heavy drops, and playful swing lock into a forward-driving flow designed to keep bodies moving, hands up, and the dancefloor fully activated in the heart of a surreal temporary city.
