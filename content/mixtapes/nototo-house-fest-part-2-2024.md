House Fest Part II finds NOTOTO shifting into a deeper, darker bass-driven lane, trading bright house energy for heavier low end and shadowy grooves. Anchored by trapstep rhythms and sustained pressure, the set explores a moodier side of the floor while maintaining forward momentum and club-ready impact.
