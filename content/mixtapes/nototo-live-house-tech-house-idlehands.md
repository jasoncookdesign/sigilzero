Recorded live at idlehands, this set captures NOTOTO delivering a tight, groove-centered blend of house and tech house built for an intimate club floor. Clean percussion, rolling basslines, and subtle builds create a steady, confidence-driven flow designed to keep energy moving without overplaying its hand.
