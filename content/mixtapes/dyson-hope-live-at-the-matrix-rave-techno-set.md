Recorded live at The Matrix Rave in Austin, TX, this techno-focused set captures Dyson Hope delivering a dark, high-pressure performance built around unreleased originals and neuro-tinged rhythms. Driving kicks, mechanical grooves, and sustained tension define a peak-time warehouse flow, locking the room into a relentless, cyberpunk-inflected pulse throughout the night.
