Recorded live at EclipseFest 2024 at RGK Ranch, this outdoor set captures NOTOTO soundtracking a rare celestial moment with a flowing, high-energy party mix built for open air and collective movement. Groove-forward selections, buoyant basslines, and sustained momentum create a celebratory arc designed to match the charged atmosphere of an eclipse-aligned dancefloor.
