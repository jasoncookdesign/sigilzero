Recorded live during Halloween weekend at Goldfinch in Denver for Turndown Service, this set finds Dyson Hope delivering a tightly mixed tech house session built for a packed nightclub floor. Driving grooves, crisp percussion, and playful basslines lock into a confident, forward-moving flow designed to keep energy high and bodies moving deep into the night.
