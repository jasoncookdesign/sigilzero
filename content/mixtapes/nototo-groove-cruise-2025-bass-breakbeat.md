Recorded live at Groove Cruise 2025, this set finds NOTOTO blending bass-heavy selections with breakbeat-driven energy in a fast-moving, dancefloor-focused mix. Rolling low end, crisp breaks, and playful rhythmic switches give the set a buoyant, high-energy feel tailored for open-air cruise floors and late-night momentum.
