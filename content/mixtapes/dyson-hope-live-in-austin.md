Recorded live in Austin during Halloween weekend, this set captures Dyson Hope delivering a dark, gangsta-leaning bass assault at a Batman-themed rave inside Irregardless.13. Heavy trapstep rhythms, menacing low-end pressure, and sharp percussive hits drive a warehouse-ready mix built for masked crowds, late-night energy, and full-throttle peak-time impact.
