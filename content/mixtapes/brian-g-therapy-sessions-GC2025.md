Recorded live at Groove Cruise 2025, this Therapy Sessions edition finds Brian G delivering a tightly controlled, groove-driven set that moves seamlessly between driving techno, tech house swing, and progressive momentum. Built for a packed club-theater floor, the mix balances hypnotic repetition with emotional lift, capturing the cathartic, late-night energy of the cruise at full throttle.
