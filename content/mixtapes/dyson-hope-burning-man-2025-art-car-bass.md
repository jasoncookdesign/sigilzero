Recorded live on an art car at Burning Man 2025, this bass-forward set captures Dyson Hope pushing heavy low-end pressure through trapstep, neuro breaks, and bass house hybrids built for open desert systems. Aggressive drops, warped breakbeats, and rolling sub weight collide in a raw, kinetic mix designed to hit hard in motion—music engineered for dust, speed, and late-night momentum on the playa.
