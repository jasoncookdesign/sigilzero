Recorded deep in the playa at Burning Man 2025, this set captures Dyson Hope in a more stripped, hypnotic mode—rolling techno pressure built for long horizons, minimal light, and altered perception. Relentless grooves, subtle modulation, and sustained tension create a meditative forward pull, turning the open desert into a moving, liminal dancefloor.
