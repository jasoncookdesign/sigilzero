Dyson Hope is a long-arc artist shaped by transmission towers, warehouse floors, and the long memory of rave culture. Cutting his teeth as an FM radio DJ before descending into the late-’90s Los Angeles underground, his sound was forged in an era where music was discovered at 3 AM, not optimized for feeds. That lineage still shows.

Today, Dyson Hope channels decades of dancefloor intuition into forward-leaning, genre-agnostic records, dark techno pressure, warped breakbeats, experimental bass, and tech house grit braided into a single, coherent signal. His work favors tension over release, hypnosis over excess, and groove as a delivery system for weight.

SIGIL.ZERO serves as both archive and evolution: the first official home for a long-buried back catalog alongside new material that proves the signal never faded—only sharpened.
