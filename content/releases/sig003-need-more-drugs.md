“Need More Drugs” is a dark, driving breakbeat cut that sits at the intersection
of funky groove and hard bass-driven grit. Dyson Hope’s remix pushes the tension
into peak-time dark techno territory, while Brian G's rework twists the original into a
deep, progressive house mutation. The flip, Disco Fever, gets an original treatment
from Dyson Hope and NOTOTO showcasing hard bassy breakbeat while Dyson Hope's remix
reinterprets it as a bass house jam.
