At Your Own Risk is a raw debut statement from Dyson Hope—an album built for dark rooms, stressed systems, and bodies in motion. It moves freely between warehouse techno, bass house pressure, and left-field breakbeat aggression, unified by a utilitarian, no-safety-rails mindset. This is not genre tourism; it’s a stress test.

Across eight tracks, the album favors tension over polish and impact over comfort. Tempos swing from disciplined mid-tempo grinders to high-velocity assaults, with stark low-end, industrial textures, and hook fragments that feel torn from corrupted signal paths. Each track operates like a subsystem—self-contained, functional, and unforgiving—yet the record as a whole reads as a coherent operating environment for DJs and late-night listeners alike.

At Your Own Risk documents a producer sharpening tools rather than chasing trends. It’s music designed to be deployed, not admired—built for concrete floors, blown speakers, and moments where restraint fails. Enter knowingly.
