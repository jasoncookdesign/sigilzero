Cutting his teeth as an FM radio DJ before descending into the late-’90s Los Angeles underground, his sound was forged in an era where music was discovered at 3 AM, not optimized for feeds. That lineage still shows.\n\nToday, Dyson Hope channels decades of dancefloor intuition into forward-leaning, genre-agnostic records, dark techno pressure, warped breakbeats, experimental bass, and tech house grit braided into a single, coherent signal. His work favors tension over release, hypnosis over excess, and groove as a delivery system for weight.\n\nSIGIL.ZERO serves as both archive and evolution: the first official home for a long-buried back catalog alongside new material that proves the signal never faded—only sharpened."},{"meta":{"id":"b-squared","slug":"b-squared","name":"B²","order":1,"roles":["producer","dj"],"location":"Denver, CO","for_fans_of":["Lane 8","Ben Böhmer"],"photo":"/assets/images/artists/b-squared.jpg","instagram_handle":"dj.bellab.ig","social":{"instagram":"https://instagram.com/dj.bellab.ig","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/djbellab"},"booking_email":"dj.bellab.ig@gmail.com","label_join_year":2026,"active":true,"featured_releases":[],"featured_mixtapes":["b-squared-newmix-vol-1","b-squared-symphony-of-hearts","b-squared-smiles"],"genres_primary":["progressive house","tech house","melodic techno"],"tags":[]},"body":"\nB² brings clarity, lift, and emotional intelligence to the dancefloor. A fixture of the Denver scene for years, her sets and productions are defined by forward motion that feels earned—melodic without being indulgent, driving without becoming blunt.\n\nHer sound lives in the space where progressive house and melodic techno intersect: long arcs, patient builds, and moments that land with warmth instead of force. There’s a sense of trust in her pacing—music that invites dancers in rather than overwhelming them.\n\nOn SIGIL.ZERO, B² translates that DJ sensibility into releases that feel intentional, human, and quietly powerful, tracks designed to move bodies while leaving space for feeling."},{"meta":{"id":"nototo","slug":"nototo","name":"NOTOTO","order":1,"roles":["producer","dj"],"location":"Austin, TX","for_fans_of":["Claude VonStroke","Walker & Royce"],"photo":"/assets/images/artists/nototo.jpg","instagram_handle":"djnototo","social":{"instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/djnototo/","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/nototoatx","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3KgRytnupNNLB7J8G9iRyC?si=TgP-QRmOQASTqSKdJHMB4A","other":[]},"booking_email":"bookings@sigilzero.com","label_join_year":2025,"active":true,"featured_releases":["SIG003"],"featured_mixtapes":["nototo-groove-cruise-2025-bass-breakbeat","nototo-bass-house-set-2024"],"genres_primary":["breakbeats","bass house"],"tags":[]},"body":"\nNOTOTO blends bass house, breakbeats, and rave nostalgia into high-energy sets built for packed dancefloors and late-night chaos.\n"},{"meta":{"id":"dj-anti","slug":"dj-anti","name":"DJ AnTi","order":2,"roles":["producer","dj"],"location":"Houston, TX","for_fans_of":["Nico Moreno","Eli Brown"],"photo":"/assets/images/artists/dj-anti.jpg","instagram_handle":"alwaysantidj","social":{"instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/alwaysantidj/","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/anti-anti-1","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4gIzOwCGU0LG8AVT5y7dkY?si=M5gSyzuYSD-_ScXtKbsxQQ","other":[]},"booking_email":"bookings@sigilzero.com","label_join_year":2023,"active":true,"featured_releases":["SIG001"],"featured_mixtapes":[],"genres_primary":["drum & bass","bass house","hard techno"],"tags":[]},"body":"\nDJ AnTi is a shape-shifter with roots in impact. Emerging from the Southern California rave circuit alongside Dyson Hope, he first made his mark in drum & bass—where precision, pressure, and low-end discipline are non-negotiable.\n\nThat foundation now fuels a broader palette: bass house grooves with bite, hard techno edges, and a persistent sense of forward aggression tempered by control.

It’s music that knows when to soar and when to smile, designed for long nights that don’t take themselves too seriously.\n\nHis work on SIGIL.ZERO captures that balance: polished, crowd-aware tracks that feel expansive, positive, and effortlessly danceable."}],"showSeriesFilter":false}],["$L3"],"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
