Cutting his teeth as an FM radio DJ before descending into the late-’90s Los Angeles underground, his sound was forged in an era where music was discovered at 3 AM, not optimized for feeds. That lineage still shows.\n\nToday, Dyson Hope channels decades of dancefloor intuition into forward-leaning, genre-agnostic records, dark techno pressure, warped breakbeats, experimental bass, and tech house grit braided into a single, coherent signal. His work favors tension over release, hypnosis over excess, and groove as a delivery system for weight.\n\nSIGIL.ZERO serves as both archive and evolution: the first official home for a long-buried back catalog alongside new material that proves the signal never faded—only sharpened."}]]}]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"py-16 section-band ","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container-sigil px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"h-md mb-3","children":"Releases"}],["$","ul",null,{"children":[["$","li","sig004",{"children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/releases/got-a-body","children":"Got a Body"}]}],["$","li","sig003",{"children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/releases/need-more-drugs","children":"Need More Drugs"}]}],["$","li","sig002",{"children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/releases/get-up-and-go","children":"Get Up and Go"}]}],["$","li","sig001",{"children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/releases/at-your-own-risk","children":"At Your Own Risk"}]}]]}]]}]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"py-16 section-band ","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container-sigil px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"h-md mb-3","children":"Mixtapes"}],["$","ul",null,{"children":[["$","li","dyson-hope-burning-man-2025-sound-camp-house",{"children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/mixtapes/dyson-hope-burning-man-2025-sound-camp-house","children":"Dyson Hope - Burning Man 2025 Sound Camp House"}]}],["$","li","dyson-hope-burning-man-2025-deep-playa-techno",{"children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/mixtapes/dyson-hope-burning-man-2025-deep-playa-techno","children":"Dyson Hope - Burning Man 2025 Deep Playa Techno"}]}],["$","li","dyson-hope-burning-man-2025-art-car-bass",{"children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/mixtapes/dyson-hope-burning-man-2025-art-car-bass","children":"Dyson Hope - Burning Man 2025 Art Car Bass"}]}],["$","li","dyson-hope-mixtape-2025",{"children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/mixtapes/dyson-hope-mixtape-2025","children":"Dyson Hope – SIGIL.ZERO Ritual Mix 2025"}]}],["$","li","dyson-hope-live-at-the-matrix-rave-techno-set",{"children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/mixtapes/dyson-hope-live-at-the-matrix-rave-techno-set","children":"Dyson Hope - Live at The Matrix Rave (techno set)"}]}],["$","li","dyson-hope-live-in-austin",{"children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/mixtapes/dyson-hope-live-in-austin","children":"Dyson Hope - Live in Austin"}]}]]}]]}]}]]}],[["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/ec85fd2886a8b556.js","async":true}]],["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
