Cutting his teeth as an FM radio DJ before descending into the late-’90s Los Angeles underground, his sound was forged in an era where music was discovered at 3 AM, not optimized for feeds. That lineage still shows.\n\nToday, Dyson Hope channels decades of dancefloor intuition into forward-leaning, genre-agnostic records, dark techno pressure, warped breakbeats, experimental bass, and tech house grit braided into a single, coherent signal. His work favors tension over release, hypnosis over excess, and groove as a delivery system for weight.\n\nSIGIL.ZERO serves as both archive and evolution: the first official home for a long-buried back catalog alongside new material that proves the signal never faded—only sharpened."}]]}]}]}]]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"py-16 section-band ","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container-sigil px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"h-md mb-6","children":"Releases"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6","children":[["$","$L3","got-a-body",{"release":{"catalog_number":"SIG004","id":"got-a-body","slug":"got-a-body","title":"Got a Body","type":"single","series_id":"core","primary_artists":["dyson-hope"],"remix_artists":[],"release_date":"2026-01-20","preorder_date":"","status":"upcoming","genres":["tech house"],"moods":["dark","peak-time","industrial"],"bpm_range":"130-140","key_center":"F minor | 4A","cover_art":"/assets/images/releases/sig004_cover.jpg","background_art":"","label_copy_short":"Hard, dark, tech house.","flagship":true,"active":true,"link_groups":{"streaming":"SIG004-streaming","purchase":"SIG004-purchase","other":"SIG004-other"},"tracks":[{"id":"SIG004","title":"Got a Body","position":1,"primary_artists":["dyson-hope"],"remix_artists":[],"isrc":"US-XXX-25-00001","bpm":130,"key":"F minor | 4A","duration_seconds":360,"preview_url":""}],"dj_use_cases":["peak-time","warehouse"],"playlists_featured_on":[]}}],["$","$L3","need-more-drugs",{"release":{"catalog_number":"SIG003","id":"need-more-drugs","slug":"need-more-drugs","title":"Need More Drugs","type":"maxi-single","series_id":"core","primary_artists":["dyson-hope"],"remix_artists":["nototo"],"release_date":"2025-12-23","preorder_date":"","status":"released","genres":["breakbeat","techno","house","bass house","progressive house"],"moods":["dark","peak-time","industrial"],"bpm_range":"130-140","key_center":"F minor | 4A","cover_art":"/assets/images/releases/sig003_cover.jpg","background_art":"","label_copy_short":"Hard, dark, funky breakbeat with Industrial-tinged techno, bass house, and progressive house remixes.","flagship":true,"active":true,"link_groups":{"streaming":"SIG003-streaming","purchase":"SIG003-purchase","other":"SIG003-other"},"tracks":[{"id":"SIG003-A","title":"Need More Drugs","position":1,"primary_artists":["dyson-hope","nototo"],"remix_artists":[],"isrc":"US-XXX-25-00001","bpm":134,"key":"F minor | 4A","duration_seconds":360,"preview_url":""},{"id":"SIG003-B","title":"Disco Fever","position":2,"primary_artists":["dyson-hope","nototo"],"remix_artists":[],"isrc":"US-XXX-25-00001","bpm":134,"key":"F minor | 4A","duration_seconds":360,"preview_url":""},{"id":"SIG003-C","title":"Need More Drugs (Dyson Hope Remix)","position":3,"primary_artists":["dyson-hope","nototo"],"remix_artists":["dyson-hope"],"isrc":"US-XXX-25-00001","bpm":134,"key":"F minor | 4A","duration_seconds":360,"preview_url":""},{"id":"SIG003-D","title":"Disco Fever (Dyson Hope Remix)","position":4,"primary_artists":["dyson-hope","nototo"],"remix_artists":["dyson-hope"],"isrc":"US-XXX-25-00001","bpm":134,"key":"F minor | 4A","duration_seconds":360,"preview_url":""},{"id":"SIG003-E","title":"Need More Drugs (Brian G Remix)","position":5,"primary_artists":["dyson-hope","nototo"],"remix_artists":["brian-g"],"isrc":"US-XXX-25-00001","bpm":134,"key":"F minor | 4A","duration_seconds":360,"preview_url":""}],"dj_use_cases":["peak-time","warehouse"],"playlists_featured_on":[]}}],"$L4","$L5"]}]]}]}],"$L6"]}],["$L7"],"$L8"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
