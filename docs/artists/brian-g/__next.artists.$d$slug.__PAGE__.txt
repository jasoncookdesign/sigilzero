Known for progressive sets that prioritize movement, melody, and connection, his sound leans into joy without sacrificing depth.\n\nRooted in progressive house and melodic techno with flashes of neo-trance energy, Brian G’s music favors forward motion and big-room feeling—but always with a wink. It’s music that knows when to soar and when to smile, designed for long nights that don’t take themselves too seriously.\n\nHis work on SIGIL.ZERO captures that balance: polished, crowd-aware tracks that feel expansive, positive, and effortlessly danceable."}]]}]}]}]]}],false,false]}],[["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/7be9ad7370d47f1d.js","async":true}]],["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
