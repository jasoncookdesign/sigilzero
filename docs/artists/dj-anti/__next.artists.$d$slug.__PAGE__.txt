Emerging from the Southern California rave circuit alongside Dyson Hope, he first made his mark in drum & bass—where precision, pressure, and low-end discipline are non-negotiable.\n\nThat foundation now fuels a broader palette: bass house grooves with bite, hard techno edges, and a persistent sense of forward aggression tempered by control. His tracks feel engineered for dark rooms and serious systems—music that moves fast, hits hard, and doesn’t apologize.\n\nOn SIGIL.ZERO, DJ AnTi represents kinetic evolution: an artist unafraid to cross lanes while keeping the energy uncompromising."}]]}]}],false,false]}],[["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/ec85fd2886a8b556.js","async":true}]],["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
