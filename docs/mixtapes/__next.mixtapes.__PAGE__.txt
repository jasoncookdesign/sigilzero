There’s a sense of trust in her pacing—music that invites dancers in rather than overwhelming them.\n\nOn SIGIL.ZERO, B² translates that DJ sensibility into releases that feel intentional, human, and quietly powerful, tracks designed to move bodies while leaving space for feeling."},{"meta":{"id":"brian-g","slug":"brian-g","name":"Brian G","roles":["producer","dj"],"location":"Austin, TX","for_fans_of":["Anyma","Adriatique"],"photo":"/images/artists/brian-g.jpg","instagram_handle":"djbriangsd","social":{"instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/djbriangsd/","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/brian-garlick","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/2Sy5MosvmK6bGKyEr1jrtn","other":[]},"booking_email":"bookings@sigilzero.com","label_join_year":2025,"active":true,"featured_releases":["SIG003"],"featured_mixtapes":[],"genres_primary":["progressive house","melodic techno","neo trance"],"tags":["euphoric drive","playful progression","open-air energy","melodic optimism","crowd connection"]},"body":"\nBrian G is a reminder that seriousness and fun don’t have to be opposites.

Cutting his teeth as an FM radio DJ before descending into the late-’90s Los Angeles underground, his sound was forged in an era where music was discovered at 3 AM, not optimized for feeds. That lineage still shows.\n\nToday, Dyson Hope channels decades of dancefloor intuition into forward-leaning, genre-agnostic records, dark techno pressure, warped breakbeats, experimental bass, and tech house grit braided into a single, coherent signal. His work favors tension over release, hypnosis over excess, and groove as a delivery system for weight.\n\nSIGIL.ZERO serves as both archive and evolution: the first official home for a long-buried back catalog alongside new material that proves the signal never faded—only sharpened."},{"meta":{"id":"nototo","slug":"nototo","name":"NOTOTO","roles":["producer","dj"],"location":"Austin, TX","for_fans_of":["Claude VonStroke","Walker & Royce"],"photo":"/images/artists/nototo.jpg","instagram_handle":"nototo_music","social":{"instagram":"https://instagram.com/nototo_music","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/nototo","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/000000000000001","bandcamp":"https://nototo.bandcamp.com","youtube":"https://youtube.com/@nototo","other":[]},"booking_email":"bookings@sigilzero.com","label_join_year":2025,"active":true,"featured_releases":["SIG003"],"featured_mixtapes":["nototo-groove-cruise-2025-bass-breakbeat","nototo-bass-house-set-2024"],"genres_primary":["breakbeats","bass house"],"tags":["playful","party","groove"]},"body":"\nNOTOTO blends bass house, breakbeats, and rave nostalgia into high-energy sets built for packed dancefloors and late-night chaos.\n"}]}],["$L3"],"$L4"]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
