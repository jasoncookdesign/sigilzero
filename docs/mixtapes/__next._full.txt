Cutting his teeth as an FM radio DJ before descending into the late-’90s Los Angeles underground, his sound was forged in an era where music was discovered at 3 AM, not optimized for feeds. That lineage still shows.\n\nToday, Dyson Hope channels decades of dancefloor intuition into forward-leaning, genre-agnostic records, dark techno pressure, warped breakbeats, experimental bass, and tech house grit braided into a single, coherent signal. His work favors tension over release, hypnosis over excess, and groove as a delivery system for weight.\n\nSIGIL.ZERO serves as both archive and evolution: the first official home for a long-buried back catalog alongside new material that proves the signal never faded—only sharpened."},{"meta":{"id":"b-squared","slug":"b-squared","name":"B²","order":1,"roles":["producer","dj"],"location":"Denver, CO","for_fans_of":["Lane 8","Ben Böhmer"],"photo":"/assets/images/artists/b-squared.jpg","instagram_handle":"dj.bellab.ig","social":{"instagram":"https://instagram.com/dj.bellab.ig","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/djbellab"},"booking_email":"dj.bellab.ig@gmail.com","label_join_year":2026,"active":true,"featured_releases":[],"featured_mixtapes":["b-squared-newmix-vol-1","b-squared-symphony-of-hearts","b-squared-smiles"],"genres_primary":["progressive house","tech house","melodic techno"],"tags":[]},"body":"\nB² brings clarity, lift, and emotional intelligence to the dancefloor.

There’s a sense of trust in her pacing—music that invites dancers in rather than overwhelming them.\n\nOn SIGIL.ZERO, B² translates that DJ sensibility into releases that feel intentional, human, and quietly powerful, tracks designed to move bodies while leaving space for feeling."},{"meta":{"id":"nototo","slug":"nototo","name":"NOTOTO","order":1,"roles":["producer","dj"],"location":"Austin, TX","for_fans_of":["Claude VonStroke","Walker & Royce"],"photo":"/assets/images/artists/nototo.jpg","instagram_handle":"djnototo","social":{"instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/djnototo/","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/nototoatx","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3KgRytnupNNLB7J8G9iRyC?si=TgP-QRmOQASTqSKdJHMB4A","other":[]},"booking_email":"bookings@sigilzero.com","label_join_year":2025,"active":true,"featured_releases":["SIG003"],"featured_mixtapes":["nototo-groove-cruise-2025-bass-breakbeat","nototo-bass-house-set-2024"],"genres_primary":["breakbeats","bass house"],"tags":[]},"body":"\nNOTOTO blends bass house, breakbeats, and rave nostalgia into high-energy sets built for packed dancefloors and late-night chaos.\n"},{"meta":{"id":"dj-anti","slug":"dj-anti","name":"DJ AnTi","order":2,"roles":["producer","dj"],"location":"Houston, TX","for_fans_of":["Nico Moreno","Eli Brown"],"photo":"/assets/images/artists/dj-anti.jpg","instagram_handle":"alwaysantidj","social":{"instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/alwaysantidj/","soundcloud":"https://soundcloud.com/anti-anti-1","spotify":"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4gIzOwCGU0LG8AVT5y7dkY?si=M5gSyzuYSD-_ScXtKbsxQQ","other":[]},"booking_email":"bookings@sigilzero.com","label_join_year":2023,"active":true,"featured_releases":["SIG001"],"featured_mixtapes":[],"genres_primary":["drum & bass","bass house","hard techno"],"tags":[]},"body":"\nDJ AnTi is a shape-shifter with roots in impact.
